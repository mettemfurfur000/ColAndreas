# ColAndreas

This is a fork of ColAndreas, but not an actual SAMP-plugin, just a physics server and a Lua library that communicates with a server for raycasts and so.

Really useful when used with RakSamp!

Theres also a rewritten version of the WizardApp, which is used to generate a .cadb file from a game files
